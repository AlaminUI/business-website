           <p>  One of the biggest struggles we see is businesses who don’t know their audience. Facebook ads are especially targeted to certain users and a catered audience.

          <h2>Facebook Advertising Services


          </h2>
       
          <p>Facebook advertising is one of the many services we offer. Our Facebook Advertising services have proven to be successful and fruitful for previous and current clients. 

          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the major benefits of advertising on one of the oldest forms of social media.

          </p>
          <h3>Facebook is now Meta
          </h3>
          <p>The Facebook brand recently rebranded into “Meta.” Meta currently owns the top 4 mobile apps in the world: Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Messenger, as well as Oculus VR. This means that any advertising that happens on Facebook can easily be spread to these other apps and increase the scope of users who see and potentially engage with your brand.

          </p>
          <h3>Customizability</h3>
          <p> Facebook ads are extremely customizable, including your call-to-action button. This makes our <a href="pay-per-click-ppc.html">personalized approach to every ad campaign</a> effective within Facebook advertising. This also helps businesses to be able to change their ads as needed. 

          </p>
          <p> As we track the effectiveness and success of different advertisements we can learn what attracts consumers and what doesn’t. Then with Facebook customizability it’s easy to change up the ads to fit the content that seems to be more effective.

          </p>
          <p> This includes <a href="pay-per-click-ppc.html">video and image ads</a>, as well as different call-to-action buttons.You can customize your ads to increase your campaign’s effectiveness on Facebook and the rest of their platforms that fall under the Meta umbrella.

          <h2>Quick Set-Up & Fast Results

          </h2>
       <p> With Facebook ads, it is easy to set up and to launch ad campaigns quickly, if you know what you are doing.

       </p>

          <h2>Targeting & Retargeting

          </h2>
          
          <p> Facebook advertising has a customizable audience targeting feature. As a team, we will work together to figure out the ideal audience type for your brand. Who you should be targeting to get the most clicks, engagement, and hopefully future customers.

          </p>
          <p> Facebook also offers different audience targets for different advertising campaigns. As our strategy starts out, we can target multiple different audience types to find out which content works best with which audience. The benefit of a multiple-ad campaign is finding out what works the best so we know how to move forward.

          </p>
          <p> And finally, a key feature in Facebook advertising is the ability to retarget your ads. Facebook ads allows businesses to retarget users that have interacted with your ads previously. We can track this information and continue to reach out to users who have shown potential interest but who have not taken action. 

          </p>
          <p> One touchpoint is usually not enough to grab someone’s attention and lead them to answer your call to action and into your pipeline. But sometimes it just takes one extra push to create a loyal customer. This is why retargeting is an essential component of any Facebook ads campaign.

          <h2>Organic Posting Reach Has a Limit
          </h2>
        <p> While your own business page on Facebook may be getting a bit of traffic, it has a limit. In fact, only a small percentage of your followers actually see what you post most of the time. Facebook has also been decreasing the visibility of business pages in newsfeeds. This means that your target audience likely has to manually go onto your business page to see your posts. And that doesn’t happen much, which is where Facebook ads come into play.

        </p>
        <p> Facebook has announced the recent shift to dedicate more newsfeed space to posts from your friends and family. But since these posts are interrupted with ads, there is a golden opportunity to reach your target audience.

        </p>
        <p> And with our team’s experience and strategies, Facebook ads are the best way to get the biggest bang for your buck. They are only effective if you know how to create and target the ads purposely, and that’s our expertise at Wedgewood Marketing. The pipeline growth, awareness, and ROI you will see are more than worth your investment. 

        </p>
        <p> Facebook isn’t the only social platform that’s ripe for paid ad campaigns. That’s why we also offer other social media advertising options and Amazon marketing services as well.

        </p>
        <p> Along with Facebook we have expertise and experience in Instagram ads and LinkedIn ads for businesses who wish to pursue those platforms and audiences. Each platform has a different audience and different regular users, making each platform unique in its ROI offering. 

        </p>
        <p> If you are unsure which social media platform would be best for your business to start, contact us for a free marketing audit! We would be happy to discuss your brand and advertising goals to see which one is the best fit.
